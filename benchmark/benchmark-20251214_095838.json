Unfortunately, I have some news that might not be what you're hoping to hear.\n\nFaye insurance is only available to residents of the United States. Since you're located in Queensland, Australia, you wouldn't be eligible for coverage with us at this time.\n\nJust to be clear, even though Faye is available across all US states, we're unable to serve customers outside the United States—with the exception that we also don't cover residents of these US territories: United States Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico.\n\nI know this might be disappointing, but I'd recommend looking into travel insurance options that are available in Australia for your trip.

    "reason": "The agent failed to follow the core instruction. The instruction explicitly states: \"do not ask which US state they will visit. Instead, inform them that Faye insurance is only available to US residents of all states, except for residents of the following US territories: [list].\"\n\nThe agent's response contains a critical error in how it communicates the eligibility information. The agent states \"we're unable to serve customers outside the United States—with the exception that we also don't cover residents of these US territories\" which is logically confusing and inverts the message. The instruction requires clearly stating that Faye IS available to US residents of all states, BUT NOT available to residents of those specific territories.\n\nThe agent's phrasing suggests Faye doesn't serve outside the US \"except that we also don't cover\" the territories, which is convoluted and contradicts the clear instruction to inform about availability to US residents with those territory exclusions. Additionally, the agent provided unnecessary information about travel insurance in Australia, which, while helpful in tone, goes beyond the scope of the instruction.\n\nThe core logic is muddled rather than close enough to the expected answer."
