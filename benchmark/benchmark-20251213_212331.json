    "agent_answer": "Hi there! Thanks for reaching out, and I appreciate you checking before purchasing. \n\nI want to be upfront with you: Faye insurance is currently only available to residents of the United States. Since you're based in Queensland, Australia, you wouldn't be able to purchase a policy with us at this time.\n\nHowever, I'd recommend looking into travel insurance options that are available in Australia—there are several great providers that specialize in coverage for Australian travelers. Your travel agent or a quick online search for Australian travel insurance should point you toward some solid alternatives for your trip.\n\nIs there anything else I can help clarify for you? 😊",
    "passed": false,
    "reason": "The agent failed to follow the instruction. The instruction specifically states that when a customer who is not a US resident inquires about purchasing insurance, the agent should inform them that Faye insurance is only available to US residents of all states, except for residents of the specified US territories (USVI, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico).\n\nInstead, the agent provided a simplified response stating \"Faye insurance is currently only available to residents of the United States\" without mentioning the exception for the five specific US territories. This is a critical omission because the instruction requires the agent to explicitly list the US territories where Faye insurance is NOT available.\n\nAdditionally, the agent went beyond the scope of the instruction by recommending travel insurance alternatives, which was not part of the expected response and not instructed to do.\n\nThe core logic differs significantly from what was instructed - the agent did not provide the complete eligibility information as specified in the instruction."

Unfortunately, I need to let you know that **coverage is unavailable for travel to this destination.** \n\nThis means that travel insurance wouldn't be able to cover a trip to Afghanistan at this time.

    "reason": "The agent successfully followed the instruction. The core requirement was to state that coverage is unavailable for travel to a Level 4 (\"Do Not Travel\") destination and not list any benefits. \n\nThe agent output:\n1. ✓ Clearly states \"coverage is unavailable for travel to this destination\"\n2. ✓ Specifically identifies Afghanistan as a Level 4 destination\n3. ✓ Does not list any benefits\n4. ✓ Communicates the message in a professional and empathetic manner\n\nWhile the agent's response is more conversational and longer than the expected answer (offering to help explore alternatives), the core logic and compliance with the instruction are intact. The tone is more helpful and empathetic, but this represents an enhancement rather than a deviation from the instruction. The agent did not provide policy benefits or coverage details, which was the critical requirement."

The agent acknowledged the customer's problem (policy not received in email or app)\n2. The agent clearly escalated the issue (\"I'll need to escalate to our human support team\", \"A specialist will be with you shortly\")\n3. The escalation language satisfies the critical rule - it's clear the agent is escalating even though the exact wording differs from the expected answer\n\nWhile the agent's tone is more empathetic and conversational (including \"I'm sorry you haven't received your policy yet\" and an emoji) compared to the expected answer's more direct approach, this is acceptable per the guidelines. The agent also provided additional helpful context (mentioning the team will have account access and investigate), which adds value without detracting from the core instruction.\n\nThe core logic matches: recognize the issue, confirm both channels were checked, and escalate appropriately."

    "passed": false,
    "reason": "The agent output fails to follow the instruction in a critical way. The instruction requires mentioning the Faye app as a contact method (\"You can always chat with us directly in the Faye app\"), but the agent completely omitted this option. The expected answer prominently features the app as the first contact method, while the agent only lists phone numbers and email.\n\nAdditionally, the agent includes an offer to \"transfer you to a live agent right now,\" which goes beyond the instruction and wasn't requested. While adding extra information is generally acceptable, omitting a required contact method (the Faye app) from the instruction is a significant oversight that makes the response incomplete and not close enough to the expected answer.\n\nThe agent did correctly provide the two phone numbers, email, and implied 24/7 availability, but the missing Faye app reference is a material gap in following the given instruction."

    "reason": "The agent failed to follow a critical instruction: it did not mention that rental car insurance is NOT available for residents of Hawaii. The instruction explicitly states this as the first piece of information to communicate. The expected answer doesn't explicitly mention this either, but the instruction makes it clear this is a key requirement that should be addressed, especially since the agent made an assumption about the user's location (\"Since you're heading to Italy...\") without first clarifying whether they are a Hawaii resident.\n\nAdditionally, while the agent provided accurate information about what rental car coverage includes and correctly emphasized that it's optional and added during plan selection, the omission of the Hawaii residency restriction represents a failure to fully follow the instructions provided, particularly given that this is stated as the opening constraint in the instruction."
