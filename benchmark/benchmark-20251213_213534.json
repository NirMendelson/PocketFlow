    "instruction": "If a customer inquires about purchasing insurance and states they are not a US resident, do not ask which US state they will visit. Instead, inform them that Faye insurance is only available to US residents of all states, except for residents of the following US territories: United States Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico.",
    "input": "Hi, I need help purchasing travel insurance. I’m not a US resident, I’m from Queensland. Can I buy Faye insurance for my trip?",

    "agent_answer": "Hi there! Thanks for reaching out about Faye insurance. \n\nI appreciate you letting me know about your location. Unfortunately, Faye insurance is only available to residents of the United States. Since you're based in Queensland, Australia, you wouldn't be eligible to purchase a Faye policy at this time.\n\nJust to give you the full picture—Faye is available to US residents across all states, with the exception of a few US territories including the United States Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico.\n\nI know this might not be the answer you were hoping for, but I wanted to be upfront with you. Is there anything else I can help clarify?",
    "passed": true,
    "reason": "The agent followed the core instruction correctly by not asking which US state the customer would visit, and instead informing them about Faye insurance availability. The agent provided the exact list of US territories where Faye is not available (United States Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico), which matches the expected answer.\n\nWhile the agent's response is more conversational and includes additional context (acknowledging the customer's location in Australia, being empathetic about the outcome, offering further assistance), the core logic and key information align with the instruction and expected answer. The agent conveyed the essential message that Faye is only available to US residents of all states except those specific territories.\n\nThe tone difference (more personable and detailed) does not constitute a failure, as per the evaluation criteria that tone differences with close enough core logic should pass."

    "instruction": "When a customer asks about travel to a U.S. Department of State Level 4 (\"Do Not Travel\") destination, state that coverage is unavailable and do not list any benefits. This applies regardless of state of residence.",
    "input": "Hi, I'm from TX. I want to visit my family in Afghanistan. I believe it's a Level 4 country. How much will it cost? Will it cost extra because of it?",
    "expected_answer": "Thanks for reaching out. Coverage is unavailable for travel to any U.S. Department of State Level 4 (“Do Not Travel”) destination, including Afghanistan. We’re unable to offer a policy for this trip.",
    "topic": "Coverage",
    "agent_answer": "I appreciate you thinking ahead about your trip to visit family – that's wonderful! However, I need to let you know that coverage is unavailable for travel to this destination.\n\nThis means we're unable to provide travel insurance protection for Afghanistan at this time, regardless of any additional costs. I understand this might be disappointing news, especially since you were hoping to see your family.\n\nIf you have any questions about this or would like to explore other options, I'm here to help. Is there anything else I can assist you with?",
    "passed": true,
    "reason": "The agent followed the core instruction correctly. The key requirement was to state that coverage is unavailable for Level 4 destinations and not list any benefits. The agent output accomplishes both of these critical elements:\n\n1. States coverage is unavailable: \"coverage is unavailable for travel to this destination\"\n2. Does not list any benefits: No benefits are mentioned in the response\n3. References the specific destination (Afghanistan): Explicitly mentions Afghanistan\n\nWhile the agent's tone is more empathetic and conversational than the expected answer (acknowledging family visit, expressing understanding about disappointment), this falls within acceptable variation per the critical rules. The agent also provides slightly more information by clarifying this applies \"regardless of any additional costs,\" which is additional helpful context rather than contradictory information.\n\nThe core logic of denying coverage for a Level 4 destination without listing benefits is preserved. The response is close enough to the expected answer in substance, even though the delivery style differs."

    "instruction": "The policy is emailed to the customer immediately upon purchasing. They can also view the policy in the Faye app. If this is mentioned to them and they say they have not received this, escalate.",
    "input": "Hi, I'm from NV. I paid for a policy and got a confirmation message on the website, but I never got the policy in the app or by email. What do I do?",
    "expected_answer": "Thanks for letting me know. Since the policy is emailed immediately after purchase and should also appear in the app, and you haven’t received it in either place, I’ll escalate this right away so the team can look into it for you.",
    "topic": "Email Issues",
    "agent_answer": "Thank you for providing those details! I completely understand how frustrating it must be to have your confirmation but not receive your policy documents. Since you've already checked both your email and the app, this definitely needs a closer look.\n\nI'm going to escalate your request to one of our human agents who can investigate what happened with your policy delivery and get this sorted out for you right away. They'll have access to your account and can track down exactly where your policy email and app access should be.\n\nYou should hear from them shortly, and they'll make sure you get everything you need. I appreciate your patience, and we'll get this resolved for you! 😊",
    "passed": true,
    "reason": "The agent successfully followed the instruction by escalating the customer's issue. The critical rule for escalation is met - the agent clearly states \"I'm going to escalate your request to one of our human agents\" which explicitly indicates escalation is occurring.\n\nThe core logic matches the expected answer:\n1. Acknowledges the customer hasn't received policy in email or app ✓\n2. Recognizes this requires escalation ✓\n3. Commits to escalating to appropriate team/agent ✓\n\nWhile the agent's response is more detailed and has a warmer tone than the expected answer (includes empathy about frustration, explains what the human agent will do), this additional information doesn't deviate from the instruction - it enhances it. The core instruction to escalate when a customer says they haven't received their policy in either place is fully satisfied."

Would that be helpful?",
    "passed": false,
    "reason": "The agent output fails to follow the instruction in a critical way. The instruction specifies that customers can chat in the Faye app as the primary contact method, but the agent completely omits this option. The expected answer explicitly mentions \"chat with us directly in the Faye app\" as the first contact method, which is a core part of the instruction.\n\nAdditionally, the agent's final sentence (\"If you'd prefer to chat with someone right away, I'm also able to transfer you to a live agent...\") appears to offer escalation/transfer, but this is not mentioned in the instruction and seems to add capability that may not be appropriate in this context.\n\nWhile the agent does provide the correct phone numbers and email, the omission of the Faye app chat option represents a failure to follow the complete instruction, which is not minor enough to overlook given how prominently it features in both the instruction and expected answer."

    "instruction": "You cannot extend your coverage once your trip has started. Faye travel insurance must be purchased prior to your trip, up until departure.

    "expected_answer": "Thanks for checking in. You can’t purchase a second plan to extend coverage once your trip has already begun. All policies must be purchased before the start of your trip, so we’re unable to extend or restart coverage mid-trip.",
    "topic": "Policy Changes",
    "agent_answer": "I totally understand wanting to make sure you're protected while you're still on your trip! Unfortunately, I have some important information to share about how Faye travel insurance works.\n\nYou won't be able to purchase a second plan to extend your coverage once your first plan ends during your trip. Here's what you need to know:\n\n• **All Faye travel insurance must be purchased before your trip starts** — up until your departure date\n• **You cannot extend coverage once your trip has already begun**\n• **You cannot purchase a second plan during your trip** to extend coverage after your first plan ends\n\nI know this might not be the answer you were hoping for, but these are firm requirements for all of our policies. The key is that coverage needs to be set up before you depart.\n\nIs there anything else I can help clarify about your current policy or travel insurance in general?",
    "passed": true,
    "reason": "The agent followed the instruction correctly and provided an answer that is close enough to the expected answer. \n\nCore logic alignment:\n- Both answers clearly state that you cannot purchase a second plan to extend coverage once the trip has begun\n- Both answers emphasize that all policies must be purchased before the trip starts\n- Both answers confirm that coverage cannot be extended mid-trip\n\nDifferences noted:\n- The agent's response is more detailed and uses bullet points for clarity, which is a positive enhancement\n- The agent's tone is slightly more conversational (\"I totally understand wanting to make sure...\") compared to the more direct expected answer\n- The agent includes an offer to help further (\"Is there anything else I can help clarify...\"), which is helpful customer service\n- The agent repeats the key points three times for emphasis, whereas the expected answer is more concise\n\nAccording to the critical rules provided, if the tone is different but core logic is close enough, it passes. Additionally, if the agent provides more information but core logic is close enough, it passes. This response satisfies both conditions - the core instruction is followed completely, and the additional detail and empathetic tone enhance rather than contradict the message."

    "instruction": "Rental car insurance is not available for residents of Hawaii. When available, rental car coverage must be added as an optional benefit during plan selection. If added, it protects a rental vehicle for the duration of the trip by reimbursing the traveler for: physical damage to the rental car due to collision, vandalism, theft, natural disaster, or events beyond the traveler’s control; theft of the vehicle (if unrecovered); loss-of-use charges or administrative fees charged by the rental agency.",
    "input": "Hi, I'm from CA and I'm renting a car in Italy. Can you explain what your rental car coverage includes?",
    "expected_answer": "Sure! Rental car coverage can be added as an optional benefit during plan selection. It reimburses you for physical damage to the rental vehicle caused by collision, vandalism, theft, natural disasters, or events outside your control. It also covers theft of the vehicle if it isn’t recovered, as well as loss-of-use charges or administrative fees from the rental agency.",
    "topic": "Rental car",
    "agent_answer": "Hey there! Great question – I'm happy to walk you through our rental car coverage for your Italy trip! 🚗\n\nSo here's the thing: when you're selecting your travel plan, rental car coverage is available as an optional add-on benefit. If you decide to add it, you'll have some solid protection for your rental vehicle throughout your entire trip.\n\nHere's what you'd be covered for:\n\n- **Physical damage** to the rental car – this includes damage from collisions, vandalism, theft, natural disasters, or anything else that's beyond your control\n- **Theft of the vehicle** – in case your rental car is stolen and not recovered\n- **Loss-of-use charges or administrative fees** – if the rental agency charges you these costs\n\nSo basically, if something happens to that rental car while you're enjoying Italy, this coverage helps reimburse you for those expenses. Pretty handy peace of mind for your trip!\n\nIf you have any other questions or want to add this coverage to your plan, just let me know – I'm here to help! 😊",
    "passed": false,
    "reason": "The agent failed to follow a critical instruction: it did not mention that rental car insurance is NOT available for residents of Hawaii. The instruction explicitly states this as the first and important piece of information to communicate. The expected answer does not explicitly mention this either, but the instruction clearly requires this information to be provided when discussing rental car coverage.\n\nAdditionally, the agent's response references \"your Italy trip\" which introduces context not present in the instruction or expected answer. While the core logic about what the coverage includes is accurate and matches the expected answer, the omission of the Hawaii residency restriction is a significant failure to follow the given instructions entirely.\n\nThe agent provided more conversational tone and additional helpful context (which would normally pass), but the absence of critical exclusionary information (Hawaii residents) makes this a failure to follow instructions completely."
