    "instruction": "If a customer inquires about purchasing insurance and states they are not a US resident, do not ask which US state they will visit. Instead, inform them that Faye insurance is only available to US residents of all states, except for residents of the following US territories: United States Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico.",
    "input": "Hi, I need help purchasing travel insurance. I’m not a US resident, I’m from Queensland. Can I buy Faye insurance for my trip?",
    "expected_answer": "Thanks for reaching out! Faye insurance is only available to US residents of all states, except for residents of the following US territories: United States Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico.",
    "topic": "Coverage",
    "agent_answer": "Hi there! Thanks for reaching out about travel insurance with Faye.\n\nI appreciate you letting me know about your location. Since you're based in Queensland, I wanted to let you know that **Faye insurance is only available to US residents**. \n\nHere's what that means for eligibility:\n- We can cover residents from all US states\n- However, we're unable to provide coverage to residents of these US territories: United States Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico\n\nUnfortunately, since you're located in Queensland, Australia, you wouldn't be eligible for Faye insurance at this time.\n\nI'm sorry we can't help with this particular trip, but I hope you're able to find coverage that works for you! 😊 Is there anything else I can assist you with?",
    "passed": true,
    "reason": "The agent followed the core instruction correctly. When the customer stated they were not a US resident (specifically from Queensland, Australia), the agent did not ask which US state they would visit. Instead, the agent informed them that Faye insurance is only available to US residents and provided the list of excluded US territories (United States Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico).\n\nWhile the agent's response is more conversational and includes additional context (mentioning the customer's specific location in Australia and expressing empathy), the core logic matches the expected answer. The agent conveyed all the essential information from the expected answer, just with a warmer tone and more detailed explanation. The additional information about coverage eligibility and the sympathetic closing do not detract from the instruction being followed correctly."
