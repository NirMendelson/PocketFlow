    "expected_answer": "Thanks for letting me know. Since the policy is emailed immediately after purchase and should also appear in the app, and you haven’t received it in either place, I’ll escalate this right away so the team can look into it for you.",
    "topic": "Email Issues",
    "agent_answer": "Hi! Thanks for reaching out, and I'm glad you got that confirmation—that's a great first step. \n\nYour policy should be viewable right in the Faye app, so I'd recommend checking there first. You can also view it in the Faye app. If you have not received the policy email after checking the app, please let me know.\n\nIn the meantime, if you're having any trouble locating it in the app or if you don't see it there after a quick look, just let me know and I'll be happy to help track it down for you! 😊",
    "passed": false,
    "reason": "The agent did not mention that they would escalate the issue despite it being a critical requirement of the instruction. While they provided information about checking the Faye app and indicated a willingness to help, they failed to follow the explicit instruction to escalate the situation when the customer does not receive the policy in either the email or the app. This means that the core instruction was not correctly followed."

    "input": "Hi Im from AL there is a bug in the website I get a 404. can you fix it?",

    "agent_answer": "What browser are you using to access the website (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)?",
    "passed": false,
    "reason": "The agent did not ask the user if they were using Google Chrome specifically, which is a critical step in the instructions. Instead, the agent asked which browser was being used in general, which is broader and does not confirm the user is on Chrome as required. Additionally, the agent did not mention anything about escalating the case to a support agent, which is also a necessary step if the issue persists. Therefore, while the agent's question about the browser type provides some relevant information, it does not sufficiently follow the instruction set given."
