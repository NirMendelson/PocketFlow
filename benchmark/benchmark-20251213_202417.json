    "input": "Hi, I'm from NV. I paid for a policy and got a confirmation message on the website, but I never got the policy in the app or by email. What do I do?",
    "expected_answer": "Thanks for letting me know. Since the policy is emailed immediately after purchase and should also appear in the app, and you haven’t received it in either place, I’ll escalate this right away so the team can look into it for you.",
    "topic": "Email Issues",
    "agent_answer": "I appreciate you providing those details! Since you've already checked both your email and the app but haven't received your policy documents yet, I'll need to escalate your request to one of our human agents who can look into your account directly and help get this sorted out for you right away. They'll have access to your confirmation and can track down where your policy ended up and make sure you get everything you need. Thanks for your patience—you should be connected with someone shortly!",
    "passed": true,
    "reason": "The agent successfully followed the instruction to escalate the issue. Both answers convey the same core logic:\n\n1. Acknowledges that the customer hasn't received the policy in expected locations (email and app)\n2. Confirms this is a problem that requires escalation\n3. Clearly indicates escalation will occur (agent output uses \"I'll need to escalate your request to one of our human agents\" which satisfies the critical rule for demonstrating escalation)\n\nThe agent's response includes additional helpful details (mention of checking account confirmation, tracking the policy, assurance of quick connection) which goes beyond the expected answer but doesn't contradict the instruction. The tone is slightly more detailed and reassuring than the expected answer, but this is acceptable per the evaluation criteria. The core message and action (escalating due to missing policy documents) are correctly communicated in both responses."

    "instruction": "When a user reports a 'something went wrong' error with a quote or bug, follow these steps: 1) check if the user is using the Google Chrome browser. 2) Ensure the user has a strong Wi-Fi connection. 3) If the issue persists after these checks, escalate the case to a support agent.",
    "input": "Hi Im from AL there is a bug in the website I get a 404. can you fix it?",
    "expected_answer": "Thanks for letting me know about the issue. First, what browser you're using to access the website?",
    "topic": "Web Support",
    "agent_answer": "Which browser are you using to access the website when you encounter the 404 error?",
    "passed": true,
    "reason": "The agent output follows the first critical step of the instruction correctly by asking about the browser being used. While the expected answer uses \"Thanks for letting me know about the issue\" as an opening phrase and the agent output omits this courtesy acknowledgment, the core logic is identical - both are asking the user to identify their browser as the first diagnostic step.\n\nThe agent's phrasing \"Which browser are you using to access the website when you encounter the 404 error?\" is a direct, clear way to gather the same information as the expected answer \"First, what browser you're using to access the website?\" The addition of \"when you encounter the 404 error\" provides more specific context, which is acceptable per the guidelines.\n\nBoth answers appropriately address step 1 of the instruction (check if the user is using Google Chrome browser) by requesting browser information. The agent is correctly starting the troubleshooting process in the right order. Minor wording differences and the omission of the opening acknowledgment are acceptable variations that don't affect the core logic or effectiveness of the response."

    "topic": "Web Support",
    "agent_answer": "I appreciate you providing those details, and I'm sorry you're experiencing this frustration with the quoting process. Since you've already confirmed you're using Chrome and have a strong Wi-Fi connection, this sounds like it needs a closer look from our technical team.\n\nI'm going to escalate your request to one of our human agents who has access to additional troubleshooting tools and can investigate what's causing that 404 error on your end. They'll be able to dig deeper into this and work toward getting it resolved for you.\n\nA team member will be with you shortly. Thanks for your patience! 😊",
    "passed": true,
    "reason": "The agent successfully followed the instruction and provided an answer that aligns well with the expected response. Key evaluation points:\n\n1. **Confirmation of prerequisites**: The agent acknowledged that the user had already confirmed using Chrome and having a strong Wi-Fi connection, matching the expected answer's requirement to confirm these steps.\n\n2. **Escalation**: The agent clearly escalated the case to a support agent using the phrase \"I'm going to escalate your request to one of our human agents,\" which satisfies the critical rule for escalation language.\n\n3. **Core logic match**: Both the expected and actual answers follow the same three-step instruction structure: confirm Chrome, confirm Wi-Fi, then escalate if issue persists.\n\n4. **Tone and format**: While the agent's tone is slightly warmer and more empathetic than the expected answer (apologizing for frustration, expressing patience), this is acceptable as per the evaluation criteria. The core message remains the same.\n\n5. **Additional information**: The agent provided extra helpful details (mention of \"404 error,\" reference to \"additional troubleshooting tools,\" and a reassuring closing message), which is explicitly acceptable according to the evaluation criteria.\n\nNo critical steps were missed, and the escalation was clearly communicated. The answer is functionally equivalent to the expected answer while providing a more detailed and empathetic response."
