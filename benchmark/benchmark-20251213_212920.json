    "agent_answer": "Hi there! Thanks for reaching out about Faye insurance. \n\nI appreciate you letting me know you're from Queensland. Unfortunately, Faye insurance is only available to residents of the United States. Since you're based in Australia, you wouldn't be eligible to purchase a Faye policy at this time.\n\nThat said, I'd be happy to help point you toward other travel insurance options that might work for your trip! Is there anything else I can assist you with?",
    "passed": false,
    "reason": "The agent failed to follow the instruction. The customer stated they are not a US resident (they are from Queensland, Australia), which triggered the specific instruction to inform them about Faye insurance availability.\n\nHowever, the agent did not provide the required information from the instruction. Instead of stating that \"Faye insurance is only available to US residents of all states, except for residents of the following US territories: United States Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico,\" the agent simply said Faye insurance is only available to US residents and offered alternative solutions.\n\nThe critical missing element is the specific list of US territories where Faye insurance is NOT available. The instruction explicitly requires the agent to inform customers about these five specific territories (USVI, Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico). The agent completely omitted this required information, which represents a failure to follow the instruction entirely."

    "instruction": "When a customer asks about travel to a U.S. Department of State Level 4 (\"Do Not Travel\") destination, state that coverage is unavailable and do not list any benefits. This applies regardless of state of residence.",

    "expected_answer": "Thanks for reaching out. Coverage is unavailable for travel to any U.S. Department of State Level 4 (“Do Not Travel”) destination, including Afghanistan. We’re unable to offer a policy for this trip.",
    "topic": "Coverage",
    "agent_answer": "I appreciate you checking with us about your trip! I want to be upfront with you: coverage is unavailable for travel to this destination.\n\nI understand this might be disappointing news, especially when you're hoping to visit family. Travel insurance typically can't provide coverage for Level 4 destinations due to safety concerns. This isn't something we can work around with additional fees—it's a coverage limitation for those areas.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with regarding your travel plans, or would you like to explore alternative options?",
    "passed": true,
    "reason": "The agent followed the core instruction correctly. The key requirement was to state that coverage is unavailable for Level 4 destinations and not list any benefits. The agent did this by clearly stating \"coverage is unavailable for travel to this destination.\"\n\nWhile the agent's response is more conversational and provides additional context (explaining why coverage isn't available, acknowledging disappointment, clarifying it can't be worked around) compared to the more concise expected answer, this additional information does not violate the instruction. The agent still communicated the essential message: coverage is unavailable and no benefits were listed.\n\nThe tone is warmer and more empathetic in the agent's output, but this represents a stylistic difference rather than a failure to follow instructions. The core logic matches the expected answer - clearly denying coverage for Level 4 destinations without listing benefits."

    "expected_answer": "Thanks for letting me know. Since the policy is emailed immediately after purchase and should also appear in the app, and you haven’t received it in either place, I’ll escalate this right away so the team can look into it for you.",

    "agent_answer": "Thanks for reaching out, and I'm glad you got that confirmation! I understand how frustrating it can be when things don't show up right away.\n\nYou can also view your policy in the Faye app, so that's a great place to check first. If you've already looked there and still haven't received the policy email, please let me know and I'll be happy to help track it down for you.",
    "passed": false,
    "reason": "The agent failed to follow the critical instruction to escalate when a customer says they have not received the policy. The instruction explicitly states: \"If this is mentioned to them and they say they have not received this, escalate.\"\n\nThe agent's response does not include any form of escalation. Instead, the agent:\n1. Suggests the customer check the Faye app first\n2. Asks the customer to let them know if they still haven't received it\n3. Offers to \"help track it down\" - which implies the agent will handle it themselves\n\nThe expected answer clearly escalates the issue (\"I'll escalate this right away so the team can look into it for you\"), but the agent output avoids escalation entirely and leaves the burden on the customer to follow up. This is a fundamental deviation from the instruction, not just a tone or wording difference."

Would that work for you?",
    "passed": false,
    "reason": "The agent output fails to follow the instruction in a critical way. The instruction specifically states that customers can chat in the Faye app, email, or call - these are the three primary contact methods that should be emphasized. \n\nThe agent's output:\n1. Omits mention of the Faye app chat feature entirely, which is listed first in the instructions as an always-available option\n2. Presents the phone numbers without clearly indicating which is for US/Canada (toll-free) vs international locations, making it confusing\n3. Adds an unsolicited offer to \"transfer you to a live agent right now\" which is not mentioned in the instructions and goes beyond the scope of providing contact information\n4. The formatting and approach (bulleted list with transfer offer) deviates significantly from the expected conversational tone that acknowledges all three contact methods\n\nWhile the agent does include the correct phone numbers and email address, the omission of the Faye app as a contact method is a significant oversight of the core instruction. The expected answer emphasizes that customers \"can always chat with us directly in the Faye app\" as one of three equal options, but the agent completely ignores this method."

    "instruction": "You cannot extend your coverage once your trip has started. Faye travel insurance must be purchased prior to your trip, up until departure. Additionally, you cannot purchase a second plan on trip once the first plan ends to extend coverage, all policies must be purchased prior to the start of the trip.",

    "expected_answer": "Thanks for checking in. You can’t purchase a second plan to extend coverage once your trip has already begun. All policies must be purchased before the start of your trip, so we’re unable to extend or restart coverage mid-trip.",

    "passed": true,
    "reason": "The agent followed the instruction correctly and provided an answer that aligns with the expected response. \n\nCore logic comparison:\n- Both the expected answer and agent output communicate that customers cannot purchase a second plan to extend coverage once a trip has started\n- Both clarify that all policies must be purchased before the trip starts\n- Both confirm that coverage cannot be extended mid-trip\n\nWhile the agent's response is longer and more detailed than the expected answer, it maintains the same core message and doesn't contradict the instruction. The agent adds empathetic language (\"I know this might be frustrating\") and offers additional help, which enhances the response without deviating from the core requirement.\n\nThe instruction is fully followed: the agent clearly states the policy restriction and explains why extension isn't possible, matching the essential information in the expected answer."

    "reason": "The agent output fails to follow a critical instruction: it does not mention that rental car insurance is not available for residents of Hawaii. The instruction explicitly states this as the first point that should be communicated. The expected answer does not include this detail either, but the instruction itself makes it clear this is important information that should be provided when discussing rental car coverage.\n\nAdditionally, the agent makes an assumption about the traveler's location (\"Since you're renting in Italy\") which was not mentioned in the instruction or context, potentially providing location-specific advice that may not apply to all users.\n\nWhile the agent does correctly explain what rental car coverage includes when available (physical damage, theft, loss-of-use charges, etc.), the omission of the Hawaii restriction represents a failure to fully follow the instruction provided."
