The agent:\n1. Did not ask about which US state they would visit (as instructed)\n2. Clearly stated coverage is only for US residents\n3. Listed all five excluded territories correctly\n4. Used a helpful and empathetic tone\n\nThe additional information about the customer's Australia location and the more detailed explanation does not violate the instruction—it enhances clarity. This falls within the \"pass\" criteria where the agent answer has more information than expected but the core logic is close enough."

    "agent_answer": "Hi there! Great question – I'm happy to break down our rental car coverage for you!\n\nWhen you add rental car coverage as an optional benefit during plan selection, it's designed to give you peace of mind while you're traveling. Here's what it covers:\n\n**Physical Damage Protection**\n- Collision, vandalism, theft, natural disasters, or unexpected events beyond your control\n\n**Theft Coverage**\n- If the vehicle is stolen and not recovered, you're protected\n\n**Rental Agency Charges**\n- Loss-of-use charges or administrative fees that the rental company may charge you\n\nSince you're heading to Italy, this coverage can be really helpful for your trip! Just keep in mind that you'll need to add it as an optional benefit when you're selecting your travel plan – it's not automatically included.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about how this coverage works? 😊",
    "passed": true,
    "reason": "The agent followed the instruction correctly and provided information aligned with the expected answer. While the agent's tone and presentation style differ from the expected answer (more conversational and formatted with headers), the core logic and all essential information are present and accurate:\n\n1. ✓ Confirms rental car coverage is an optional benefit added during plan selection\n2. ✓ Covers physical damage from collision, vandalism, theft, natural disasters, and events beyond traveler's control\n3. ✓ Covers theft of vehicle if unrecovered\n4. ✓ Covers loss-of-use charges and administrative fees from rental agency\n\nThe agent also added contextual details (mentioning the user's trip to Italy and that it's not automatically included), which enhances clarity without contradicting or deviating from the instruction. This additional information is helpful and relevant. The agent's response is more comprehensive and engaging than the expected answer while maintaining complete accuracy regarding the instruction requirements."
