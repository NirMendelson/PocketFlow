The agent did not include the specific list of excluded US territories as required by the instruction. This is a critical omission because the instruction explicitly requires mentioning those five specific territories.\n\nThe expected answer contains specific, required information (the five excluded territories) that must be communicated to non-US residents inquiring about insurance.

If you do happen to feel sick, you can visit **any doctor or medical facility you choose** — there's no requirement to use a specific clinic or one that's affiliated with us. \n\nWhether it's an urgent care center, hospital, or private practice, as long they're a licensed medical professional or facility, you're all set. This gives you the freedom to seek care wherever is most convenient for you, whether that's near your hotel, a recommendation from a local, or wherever works best in the moment.\n\nIs there anything else I can help clarify about your coverage while traveling?",

The response actually provides additional helpful context (mentioning convenience factors like proximity to hotel or local recommendations) without detracting from the core message. This extra information enhances the answer without contradicting the instruction.\n\nThe response directly answers the customer's needs and even offers further assistance, which is good customer service practice. All critical information from the instruction is present and accurately conveyed."

Unfortunately, rental car insurance isn't available for residents of Hawaii, so I'm unable to add that coverage to your rental in Japan.\n\nHowever, I'd recommend checking with your personal auto insurance provider or credit card company—they may offer coverage that extends to rental cars internationally, which could give you some peace of mind for your trip.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with regarding your rental?",
    "passed": true,
    "reason": "The agent successfully followed the instruction and conveyed the core logic correctly. \n\nKey information present:\n- Clearly states that rental car insurance is not available for residents of Hawaii\n- Confirms it cannot be added to the policy\n\nThe agent output goes beyond the expected answer by:\n- Providing helpful alternative suggestions (checking personal auto insurance or credit card company)\n- Offering continued assistance\n- Maintaining a professional and empathetic tone\n\nThe core instruction was followed: inform the customer that rental car insurance is unavailable for Hawaii residents and cannot be added. The agent did exactly this while also providing additional value through alternative recommendations. The tone is warmer and more conversational than the expected answer, but this is acceptable as it maintains professionalism while being more helpful to the customer.\n\nNo critical rule violations occurred. The answer contains the essential information and follows the instruction correctly."

    "instruction": "Rental car insurance is not available for residents of Hawaii. When available, rental car coverage must be added as an optional benefit during plan selection. If added, it protects a rental vehicle for the duration of the trip by reimbursing the traveler for: physical damage to the rental car due to collision, vandalism, theft, natural disaster, or events beyond the traveler’s control; theft of the vehicle (if unrecovered); loss-of-use charges or administrative fees charged by the rental agency.",
    "input": "Hi, I'm from CA and I'm renting a car in Italy. Can you explain what your rental car coverage includes?",
    "expected_answer": "Sure! Rental car coverage can be added as an optional benefit during plan selection. It reimburses you for physical damage to the rental vehicle caused by collision, vandalism, theft, natural disasters, or events outside your control. It also covers theft of the vehicle if it isn’t recovered, as well as loss-of-use charges or administrative fees from the rental agency.",
    "topic": "Rental car",
    "agent_answer": "Hi! I'd be happy to explain our rental car coverage for you.\n\nRental car coverage is an optional benefit you can add when selecting your plan, and it's designed to protect you during your trip. Here's what it includes:\n\n**Physical Damage Protection**\n- Coverage for damage to your rental vehicle from collision, vandalism, theft, natural disasters, or unexpected events beyond your control\n\n**Theft Coverage**\n- Protection if the vehicle is stolen and not recovered\n\n**Additional Fees**\n- Reimbursement for loss-of-use charges or administrative fees that the rental agency charges you\n\nSince you're planning to rent a car in Italy, this coverage would apply throughout the duration of your trip. The key thing to remember is that you'll need to add this as an optional benefit during the plan selection process—it's not included automatically.\n\nIs there anything specific about the coverage you'd like me to clarify, or do you have questions about how to add it to your plan?",
    "passed": false,
    "reason": "The agent output fails to follow a critical instruction: it does not mention that rental car insurance is NOT available for residents of Hawaii. The instruction explicitly states this as the first piece of information to communicate, which is essential context for users who may be Hawaii residents.\n\nWhile the agent correctly explains what rental car coverage includes, how to add it, and provides helpful formatting, the omission of the Hawaii restriction is a material gap that could mislead Hawaii residents into believing they can purchase this coverage when they cannot.\n\nAdditionally, the agent mentions \"you're planning to rent a car in Italy\" which appears to be context-specific to a particular conversation, but the expected answer and instruction are meant to be general information that should apply to all users, including Hawaii residents who need to know upfront that this option is unavailable to them."
