    "instruction": "Rental car insurance is not available for residents of Hawaii. When available, rental car coverage must be added as an optional benefit during plan selection. If added, it protects a rental vehicle for the duration of the trip by reimbursing the traveler for: physical damage to the rental car due to collision, vandalism, theft, natural disaster, or events beyond the traveler’s control; theft of the vehicle (if unrecovered); loss-of-use charges or administrative fees charged by the rental agency.",
    "input": "Hi, I'm from HI and I'm renting a car in Japan. How much does rental car insurance cost if I add it?",
    "expected_answer": "Thanks for reaching out! Rental car insurance is not available for residents of Hawaii, so it can’t be added to your policy.",
