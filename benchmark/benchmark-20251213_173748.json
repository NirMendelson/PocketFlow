    "expected_answer": "Thanks for letting me know. Since the policy is emailed immediately after purchase and should also appear in the app, and you haven’t received it in either place, I’ll escalate this right away so the team can look into it for you.",

    "agent_answer": "Hi! Thanks for reaching out, and I'm glad you got that confirmation—that's a great first step. \n\nYour policy should be viewable in the Faye app, so I'd recommend checking there first. If you've already looked and don't see it, or if you still haven't received a policy email after checking the app, please let me know and I'll be happy to help track this down for you.\n\nJust let me know what you find, and we'll get this sorted out! 😊"
