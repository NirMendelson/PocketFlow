Since you mentioned that you haven't received the policy email, I'll need to escalate your request to a human agent for further review and assistance. They will be able to provide more detailed help. Thank you for your understanding!",
    "passed": false,
    "reason": "The agent's response did not follow the instruction to escalate the matter immediately without asking any follow-up questions. Although the agent indicated that they would escalate the request to a human agent, they stated that they were looking into the customer's issue first, which implies a follow-up before escalation. This does not align with the requirement to escalate immediately."

For policies purchased after October 1, incidents related to the government shutdown are not covered, as the shutdown became a known event on October 1.",

    "expected_answer": "Thanks for reaching out. The government shutdown became a known event on October 1, so any policies purchased after that date do not provide coverage for incidents related to the shutdown. Because it’s already a known event, issues caused by it would not be covered.",
    "topic": "Trip Delay",
    "agent_answer": "Hi there! 😊 I understand your concern about the potential impacts of the government shutdown on your trip. Just to clarify, all policy coverages apply to unknown events. Since the government shutdown became a known event on October 1, any policies purchased after that date may not cover incidents related to the shutdown.\n\nIf you have further questions about how this affects your specific policy, I'm happy to help clarify!",
    "passed": true,
    "reason": "The agent's response correctly conveys the key information that policies purchased after October 1 do not cover incidents related to the government shutdown, which became a known event on that date. The explanation aligns with the core logic of the expected answer, providing clarity on coverage limitations related to the shutdown. Additionally, the tone is friendly and matches the expected format, making the response effective despite minor wording differences."
