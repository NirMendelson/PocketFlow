    "agent_answer": "Hi there! 😊 It sounds like you've done everything right on your end, so let's make sure you get that policy email sorted out. I'll need to escalate your request to a human agent who can review the situation and ensure everything is in order. They'll get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience!"
