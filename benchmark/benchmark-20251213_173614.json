    "expected_answer": "Thanks for letting me know. Since the policy is emailed immediately after purchase and should also appear in the app, and you haven’t received it in either place, I’ll escalate this right away so the team can look into it for you.",

    "agent_answer": "Hi there! Thanks for reaching out, and I'm glad you got that confirmation on the website—that's a good first step. \n\nYou can also view your policy directly in the Faye app if you haven't checked there yet. If you've already looked in the app and still don't see your policy, or if you haven't received the policy email after checking both places, please let me know and I'll be happy to help track it down for you."
