    "expected_answer": "Thanks for letting me know. Since the policy is emailed immediately after purchase and should also appear in the app, and you haven’t received it in either place, I’ll escalate this right away so the team can look into it for you.",

    "agent_answer": "Hi! I'm glad you got your confirmation—that's a great first step. Your policy should be available to view directly in the Faye app, so I'd recommend checking there first. If you've already looked in the app and don't see your policy, or if you still haven't received the policy email after checking the app, please let me know and I'll be happy to help track this down for you. We'll get this sorted out! 😊"
