Is there anything else I can assist you with regarding your trip?",
    "passed": true,
    "reason": "The agent followed the core instruction correctly by clearly stating that rental car insurance is not available for residents of Hawaii. While the agent's response is more conversational and longer than the expected answer, it conveys the same critical information and directive.\n\nThe agent's tone is more empathetic and helpful (acknowledging the traveler's disappointment, offering to explore other options), but this aligns with the critical rule that allows for tone differences as long as core logic is close enough. The agent did not add any conflicting information that contradicts the instruction - it simply provided the same core message with additional customer service elements.\n\nThe instruction was followed entirely: the agent communicated that rental car insurance is unavailable for Hawaii residents and cannot be added to their policy."

    "instruction": "Rental car insurance is not available for residents of Hawaii. When available, rental car coverage must be added as an optional benefit during plan selection. If added, it protects a rental vehicle for the duration of the trip by reimbursing the traveler for: physical damage to the rental car due to collision, vandalism, theft, natural disaster, or events beyond the traveler’s control; theft of the vehicle (if unrecovered); loss-of-use charges or administrative fees charged by the rental agency.",
    "input": "Hi, I'm from CA and I'm renting a car in Italy. Can you explain what your rental car coverage includes?",
    "expected_answer": "Sure! Rental car coverage can be added as an optional benefit during plan selection. It reimburses you for physical damage to the rental vehicle caused by collision, vandalism, theft, natural disasters, or events outside your control. It also covers theft of the vehicle if it isn’t recovered, as well as loss-of-use charges or administrative fees from the rental agency.",

    "agent_answer": "Hi there! I'd be happy to explain our rental car coverage for you. 🚗\n\nOur rental car coverage is available as an optional add-on that you can select during your plan purchase. If you decide to add it, here's what you'll be protected for throughout your trip:\n\n**Physical Damage Coverage:**\n- Collision, vandalism, theft, natural disasters, or unexpected events that damage the rental vehicle\n\n**Theft Protection:**\n- Coverage if the vehicle is stolen and not recovered\n\n**Additional Charges:**\n- Loss-of-use fees or administrative charges that the rental agency might impose\n\nThis coverage helps give you peace of mind while you're traveling, so you won't have to worry about unexpected costs if something happens to your rental car.\n\nSince you're planning to rent in Italy, this could be a great option to consider! Do you have any other questions about what's covered, or would you like help adding this to your plan?",
    "passed": false,
    "reason": "The agent failed to follow a critical instruction: it did not mention that rental car insurance is NOT available for residents of Hawaii. The instruction explicitly states this as the first point that should be communicated. The expected answer does not need to repeat this (since the user wasn't identified as a Hawaii resident), but the agent should have either asked about residency or been prepared to state this restriction. \n\nAdditionally, the agent made an assumption about the user's location (\"Since you're planning to rent in Italy\") that was not mentioned in the instruction context, which goes beyond the scope of the task.\n\nWhile the agent did accurately explain what the coverage includes (matching the core logic of the expected answer), the omission of the Hawaii residency restriction is a significant deviation from the instructions provided."
