    "passed": true,
    "reason": "The agent's response is close enough to the expected answer. It conveys the idea that the inquiry is being escalated to a human agent who can provide a detailed review, which matches the instruction to escalate immediately. While the tone is slightly more conversational and empathetic, and there's additional information about commitment to resolving the issue, the core logic aligns with the purpose of escalation. The response does not include irrelevant details, and it follows the instruction sufficiently."

    "instruction": "Baggage and Personal Effects coverage provides reimbursement for personal items lost, stolen, damaged, or destroyed during a covered trip, including while items are checked with a common carrier. The coverage may also include reimbursement for passport, visa, or credit card replacement, and baggage delay purchases if baggage is delayed for 12+ hours.",
    "input": "Hi, I'm from NC. Can you explain what the Baggage and Personal Effects coverage includes?",
    "expected_answer": "Sure! Baggage and Personal Effects coverage provides reimbursement for personal items that are lost, stolen, damaged, or destroyed during a covered trip — including when they’re checked with a common carrier. It may also cover reimbursement for replacing a passport, visa, or credit card, as well as purchases made if your baggage is delayed for 12 hours or more.",

    "agent_answer": "Baggage and Personal Effects coverage provides reimbursement for personal items lost, stolen, damaged, or destroyed during a covered trip, including while items are checked with a common carrier. The coverage may also include reimbursement for passport, visa, or credit card replacement, and baggage delay purchases if baggage is delayed for 12+ hours.",
    "passed": true,
    "reason": "The agent’s output closely matches the expected answer and adheres to the provided instruction. Both the agent's response and the expected answer explain that the coverage reimburses for personal items that are lost, stolen, damaged, or destroyed during a covered trip, including when checked with a common carrier. They also mention coverage for passport, visa, or credit card replacement, and baggage delay purchases if delayed for 12+ hours. Thus, the core logic is maintained, and the output is close enough to the expected answer."

    "instruction": "When answering questions about the government shutdown, clearly state that the policy does not cover incidents related to the shutdown if the event was known at the time of purchase. For policies purchased after October 1, incidents related to the government shutdown are not covered, as the shutdown became a known event on October 1.",
    "input": "Hi, I'm from CO. I'm worried the government shutdown might delay my trip. If I buy a policy now, will I be covered for issues caused by the shutdown?",
    "expected_answer": "Thanks for reaching out. The government shutdown became a known event on October 1, so any policies purchased after that date do not provide coverage for incidents related to the shutdown. Because it’s already a known event, issues caused by it would not be covered.",
    "topic": "Trip Delay",
    "agent_answer": "All policy coverages apply to unknown events. Since the government shutdown became a known event on October 1, policies purchased after this date may not be covered for incidents related to the government shutdown.\n\nIf you have further questions about how this affects your specific policy, I'm happy to help clarify.",
    "passed": true,
    "reason": "The agent's answer follows the core logic of the instruction. It correctly states that policies purchased after October 1 do not provide coverage for incidents related to the government shutdown due to it being a known event. While the wording is slightly different and less detailed than the expected answer, the essential message aligns with the instruction. The agent briefly adds an offer for further clarification, which does not detract from the adherence to the instruction."

    "input": "Hi, I'm from CA. My trip already started but I want to extend my coverage by a few more days. Can you extend my current plan?",

    "passed": true,
    "reason": "The agent's output closely mirrors the expected answer and follows the instructions provided. Although the format of the response is slightly different, the core logic and details about purchasing and extending Faye travel insurance are accurately preserved. This aligns with the criteria for passing as the core message is conveyed correctly."

    "expected_answer": "Thanks for checking in. You can’t purchase a second plan to extend coverage once your trip has already begun. All policies must be purchased before the start of your trip, so we’re unable to extend or restart coverage mid-trip.",

Additionally, you cannot purchase a second plan on trip once the first plan ends to extend coverage. All policies must be purchased prior to the start of the trip.",
    "passed": true,
    "reason": "The agent's answer, while slightly different in wording, captures the core logic of the instructions accurately. The key point is that coverage cannot be extended or restarted once the trip has started, and that all policies must be purchased before departure. Even though the tone and phrasing differ, the information communicated aligns closely with the expected answer, thus fulfilling the critical criteria for passing."

    "input": "Hi, I'm from NJ. I bought my flights three weeks ago and I have CFAR. Can I increase my trip cost to include a new hotel I booked?",
    "expected_answer": "Thanks for reaching out! Since you live in NJ, you can increase your trip cost within 15 days of purchasing the travel arrangement you're adding. Because your flights were purchased three weeks ago, you’re outside that window, so you wouldn’t be able to increase your trip cost at this point.",

    "agent_answer": "Thanks for reaching out! Since you live in New Jersey, you can increase your trip cost within 15 days of purchasing the travel arrangement you're adding. Because your travel arrangement was purchased 21 days ago, you're outside that window, so you wouldn't be able to increase your trip cost at this point.",
    "passed": true,
    "reason": "The agent's output is close to the expected answer. The core logic remains intact: the individual resides in New Jersey, which allows for a 15-day window to increase trip costs, but their travel arrangement was purchased 21 days ago, putting them outside the allowable window. The wording differs slightly (e.g., \"New Jersey\" vs \"NJ\"), but this does not affect the substantive response. The agent followed the instruction closely enough."

    "reason": "The agent's output aligns with the core logic of the expected answer, stating that rental car insurance is not available for residents of Hawaii. Although the agent's response is more concise and lacks the tone and additional information provided in the expected answer, it does not contradict the instruction. The critical detail—that rental car insurance cannot be obtained by Hawaii residents—is correctly communicated, allowing this response to pass."

    "passed": true,
    "reason": "The agent followed the instruction correctly and provided an answer that closely matches the expected one. The core logic of adding rental car coverage as an optional benefit during plan selection, along with the specific protections it offers, was accurately described. While the tone and presentation may differ slightly, the essential information regarding reimbursement for damages and associated charges is consistent with the expected answer. Therefore, it passes based on the guidelines provided."
