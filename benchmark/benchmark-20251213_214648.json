    "expected_answer": "Sure! Rental car coverage can be added as an optional benefit during plan selection. It reimburses you for physical damage to the rental vehicle caused by collision, vandalism, theft, natural disasters, or events outside your control. It also covers theft of the vehicle if it isn’t recovered, as well as loss-of-use charges or administrative fees from the rental agency.",

    "agent_answer": "Hi! I'd be happy to explain our rental car coverage for you – great question, especially since you're planning a trip to Italy!\n\nHere's what you need to know: When you're selecting your travel plan, you'll have the option to add rental car coverage as an optional benefit. If you choose to add it, you'll have peace of mind knowing your rental vehicle is protected throughout your trip.\n\nSpecifically, the coverage reimburses you for:\n\n- **Physical damage** to the rental car caused by collision, vandalism, theft, natural disaster, or anything beyond your control\n- **Theft of the vehicle** (in case it's not recovered)\n- **Loss-of-use charges or administrative fees** that the rental agency may charge you\n\nSo whether it's an accident or an unexpected event, you're covered! 🛡️ Just make sure to add it during your plan selection process so it's active for your Italy adventure.\n\nDo you have any other questions about how the coverage works?",
    "passed": true,
    "reason": "The agent successfully followed the instruction and provided information that aligns with the expected answer. The core logic matches perfectly:\n\n1. ✓ Mentions rental car coverage as an optional benefit during plan selection\n2. ✓ Explains protection for the duration of the trip\n3. ✓ Covers all four reimbursement categories:\n   - Physical damage (collision, vandalism, theft, natural disaster, events beyond control)\n   - Theft of vehicle if unrecovered\n   - Loss-of-use charges and administrative fees\n\nWhile the agent's tone is more conversational and includes additional context (mentioning the Italy trip, using formatting with bullet points, and asking follow-up questions), these additions enhance clarity without contradicting or ignoring the instruction. The core information is comprehensive and accurate, meeting the requirements of the instruction fully."
