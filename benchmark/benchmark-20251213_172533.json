    "expected_answer": "Thanks for letting me know. Since the policy is emailed immediately after purchase and should also appear in the app, and you haven’t received it in either place, I’ll escalate this right away so the team can look into it for you.",

    "agent_answer": "Hi there!\n\nThank you for reaching out. I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble receiving your policy. Here's what you can do:\n\n- First, try checking the Faye app to see if you can view your policy there. Sometimes the app updates faster than email notifications.\n  \n- If you still don't see it in the app, please let me know, and I'll assist you further.\n\nIf you have any difficulties along the way, feel free to reach out. We'll get this sorted out together! 😊"
