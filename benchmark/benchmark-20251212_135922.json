    "instruction": "If you determine that travelers reside in different states, always inform them that all travelers must live in the same state to purchase a policy together. Advise them that if they live in different states, they must purchase separate policies, even if their question was about a different topic.",
    "input": "Hi, I'm from CA. I want to buy coverage for my family trip. We are 4 — I'm Bobby Lee and my wife Andrew Santino are flying from CA to Mexico, and our daughter Rudy Jules is flying from Texas. We fly from 25/12/25 to 25/01/26. How much would it cost?",
    "expected_answer": "Thanks for reaching out! Since some travelers live in different states, you won’t be able to purchase a single policy together. All travelers must reside in the same state to be on one policy. Because your daughter lives in Texas while you and your wife live in California, you’ll need to purchase separate policies for each state. I’m happy to help guide you through each one.",
    "topic": "Coverage",
    "agent_answer": "Hi Bobby! 😊 \n\nThank you for reaching out about coverage for your family trip to Mexico! To provide you with an accurate cost, I would need a few more details about your travel plans. \n\nSince your policy includes TRIP CANCELLATION, this coverage will assist you if you need to cancel your trip for a covered reason. You can file a claim for reimbursement for any non-refundable trip expenses, up to the limit of your coverage based on the total non-refundable trip cost you entered when purchasing a Faye plan. \n\nFor a complete list of covered reasons for trip cancellation, you can check out this link: [Covered Reasons for Trip Cancellation](https://blog.withfaye.com/travel-insurance-101/covered-reasons-for-trip-cancellation/).\n\nIf you have specific trip costs like flights and accommodations, please share those so I can help you get a quote! Looking forward to assisting you further! ✈️"
