    "expected_answer": "Thanks for letting me know. Since the policy is emailed immediately after purchase and should also appear in the app, and you haven’t received it in either place, I’ll escalate this right away so the team can look into it for you.",

    "agent_answer": "I appreciate you providing those details, and I'm sorry you haven't received your policy documents yet. Since you've already checked both your email and the app after receiving your confirmation, this situation needs a closer look from our team.\n\nI'll need to escalate your request to a human agent who can investigate what happened with your policy delivery and make sure you get everything sorted out. They'll have access to your account details and can help track down your documents or resend them if needed.\n\nThank you for your patience – a team member will be with you shortly! 😊"
