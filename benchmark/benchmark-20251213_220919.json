    "instruction": "When available, rental car coverage must be added as an optional benefit during plan selection. If added, it protects a rental vehicle for the duration of the trip by reimbursing the traveler for: physical damage to the rental car due to collision, vandalism, theft, natural disaster, or events beyond the traveler’s control; theft of the vehicle (if unrecovered); loss-of-use charges or administrative fees charged by the rental agency.",
    "input": "Hi, I'm from CA and I'm renting a car in Italy. Can you explain what your rental car coverage includes?",
    "expected_answer": "Sure! Rental car coverage can be added as an optional benefit during plan selection. It reimburses you for physical damage to the rental vehicle caused by collision, vandalism, theft, natural disasters, or events outside your control. It also covers theft of the vehicle if it isn’t recovered, as well as loss-of-use charges or administrative fees from the rental agency.",
    "topic": "Rental car",
    "agent_answer": "Hi there! Great question – I'm happy to explain how our rental car coverage works for your trip to Italy.\n\nThis coverage is available as an optional add-on when you're selecting your travel plan. If you choose to include it, here's what you'll be protected for during your rental period:\n\n**Physical Damage Coverage**\nWe'll reimburse you for damage to your rental car caused by collision, vandalism, theft, natural disasters, or any unexpected events beyond your control.\n\n**Vehicle Theft**\nIf your rental car is stolen and not recovered, you're covered.\n\n**Rental Agency Fees**\nYou'll be reimbursed for any loss-of-use charges or administrative fees the rental agency charges you.\n\nThe key thing to remember is that you'll need to add this coverage as an optional benefit during the plan selection process – just make sure to select it before you finalize your plan, and it'll protect you throughout your entire trip.\n\nIs there anything else you'd like to know about this coverage before your Italy adventure? 😊",
    "passed": true,
    "reason": "The agent followed the instruction and provided an answer that is close enough to the expected one. While the tone and presentation differ (the agent used a more conversational, structured format with headers and a friendly closing), the core logic and information are consistent with the expected answer.\n\nBoth responses cover all the essential elements:\n1. Rental car coverage is available as an optional benefit during plan selection\n2. Physical damage coverage (collision, vandalism, theft, natural disasters, events beyond control)\n3. Theft of vehicle if unrecovered\n4. Loss-of-use charges and administrative fees reimbursement\n\nThe agent actually provides slightly more context and clarity by organizing the information with headers and explicitly emphasizing the timing of when to add the coverage (\"before you finalize your plan\"). The additional detail about the trip to Italy and the friendly closing are enhancements that don't contradict the instruction.\n\nThe agent did not fail to include any critical information from the instruction, and the core message remains aligned with what was expected."
