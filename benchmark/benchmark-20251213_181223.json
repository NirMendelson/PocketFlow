    "input": "Hi, I'm from NV. I paid for a policy and got a confirmation message on the website, but I never got the policy in the app or by email. What do I do?",
    "expected_answer": "Thanks for letting me know. Since the policy is emailed immediately after purchase and should also appear in the app, and you haven’t received it in either place, I’ll escalate this right away so the team can look into it for you.",
    "topic": "Email Issues",
    "agent_answer": "I appreciate you providing those details, and I'm sorry you haven't received your policy documents yet. Since you've already checked both your email and the app without finding them, this needs a bit more investigation on our end to make sure we get this sorted out for you right away.\n\nI'm going to escalate your request to one of our human agents who'll have access to your account and can track down exactly what happened with your policy delivery. They'll be able to help you much faster than I can. \n\nYou should hear from them shortly, and they'll make sure you get everything you need. Thanks for your patience! 😊"
